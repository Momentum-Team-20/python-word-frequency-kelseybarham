to remove punctuation, use replace:

s = "Hello, World!"
s = s.replace(",", "")
s = s.replace("!", "")
print(s)

output:
Hello World

\\
The lower() methods returns the lowercased string from the given string.

# input string
string = "	 Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x[30] and later are supported, with older versions still supporting e.g. Windows 7 (and old installers not restricted to 64-bit Windows)."

# convert to lower case
lower_string = string.lower()
print(lower_string)

PUNCTUATION = ['!', '.', '?']

import string
print(string.punctuation)

def remove_punctuation(str):
for character in str:
    if character in string.punctuation:
    sentence = str.replace(character, "")
return str

def convert_to_list(str):
    return str.split()

cleaned_string = remove_punctuation(sentence)
print(f'cleaned_string: {cleaned_string}')
word_list = convert_to_list(cleaned_string)
print(f'word_list: {word_list}')
